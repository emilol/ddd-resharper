            This service is introduced for performance optimization reason
            Shell in dotMemoryUnit.Server starts 5 sec. Choosed solution is keep a pool of already initialized servers and use them on demand, but problem is
            what to profile passing to server via command line arguments, so we cannot start it, and than pass arguments.
            This service solves this problem. There are two ways of using server
            1. Pass arguments as command line - profilng starts immediately, server cannot be resused
            2. Start server without specifying process to profile, use this service to start work
